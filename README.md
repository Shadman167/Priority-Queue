# Priority-Queue

This is an exercise to test the heap implementation of a priority queue. However, I write a priority queue class that uses a heap but represents a 
set of (object, priority) pairs rather than just priorities.

This is a model of an emergency room (ER) of a hospital. I needed to use a  ERPriorityQueue class organized (name, priority) pairs using 
nodes which are stored in a heap. Alongside, I implemented a HashMap and properties of trees like parent and child nodes.
